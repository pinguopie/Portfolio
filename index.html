                    <p2> The heart of Mill Me Not is to raise awareness of an ongoing yet underground issue â€” Puppy Mill. If you have not heard of the term Puppy Mill, it is an inhumane way of producing a huge amount of puppies at a high speed where profit is achieved at the expense of the dogs. Many pet shops are still supportive of such acts today as it is the fastest way to earn revenues. Hence, it has caught my attention to reach out to potential pet owners in order to lessen Puppy Mill.  </p2>

    <div class="drop2"> Length: Measure the length of your dog from nose to tail. When measuring the tail, be sure to add approximately 2-4 inches to the overall length, depending on the size of your dog.
<br><br>
Height: To determine the height of the crate you will need, measure your dog from the top of the head to the ground. If your dog has naturally erect ears, measure from the tip of the ears.
<br><br>
Width: To obtain the width of your crate, add approximately 2 inches for smaller breeds and 4 inches for larger breeds.</div>

                        <br>
                        <p4> Females are bred repeatedly, usually twice a year, every year, until they can no longer produce puppies. This is incredibly stressful on their bodies but they are viewed as moneymaking machines, as disposable property, not as individuals with inherent worth. Female dogs are commonly bred before it is safe to do so because the earlier they start, the more puppies they will produce in a lifetime.  </p4>

                        <p4> Mother dogs give birth and live with their puppies through the weaning process, which is usually prematurely forced while the puppies should still be drinking their mother's milk. This early weaning causes emotional trauma to both the mother dog and the puppies as well as health problems in the puppies. </p4>
